            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE ANSWER of Captain STEPHEN RICH, Commander of the STATE Packet Barques, and Post-Master of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Information of <hi>Evan Vaughan,</hi> late Post-Master of the same City.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat on the third of <hi>July</hi> 1646. a Packet of Letters were delivered unto Captain <hi>Stephen Rich,</hi> by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Mathew Wood,</hi> to be transported from <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> with Order for all possible diligence, and dispatch, intimating that the Letters were of great concernment touching the Publick-weale and safety of both Kingdomes, but most in Particular concerning the sad condition of the godly and well-affected English Protestants in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that Captain <hi>Rich</hi> out of distrust, that something might be written to his disadvantage, did break open that Packet, and did not deliver the Letters, but threw them behind his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine where being found by some well-affected of the Company they took Copies of them, which I humbly present to your honours view.</p>
            <p>To the first this defendant saith;</p>
            <p>That he was not Post-master at the same time when Captain <hi>Mathew Wood</hi> delivered to this Defendant the Letters in the Information mentioned, or intended and therefore conceiveth himselfe under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to be chargeable therewith, and humbly prayeth the Judgement of this honourable Committee, whether he shall be compelled to make any further Answer to this particular Charge, being charged against him, as a misdemeanour in his Imployment before he had it; Howsoever hee this Defendant, for full satisfaction of this honourable Committee, saith
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:211673:3"/>and acknowledgeth, That true it is, that about that time hee received some Letters from Captain <hi>Wood,</hi> which he desired might be sent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction thereof; Whereupon this Defendant out of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse to further any matter conducing to the good of the State, did promise to give them the same Conveyance with his own Letters. At which time this Defendant having Order to observe the Command of Collonell <hi>Mitton,</hi> was at his arrivall at <hi>Holy-head</hi> sent for into <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvan</hi>-shire, where he was forced to attend his duty, whereby hee was constrained to commit the Conveyance of the said Letters with his own Letters, to the Care of the Master of the Ship, and the Minister men found honest in as great a trust, to be sent by the first opportunitie, that could be, no Post being then setled at <hi>Holy-head.</hi> But this Defendant doth deny that he broke open any of the said Letters delivered to him by the said Captain <hi>Wood,</hi> or had any distrust that any thing was written therein to his disadvantage, nor had he any cause so to doe, and faith that if any of the said Ships Company did open any of the said Letters, or took any Copies thereof, the same is altogether unknown unto him, this Defendant; neither did, or doth he this Defendant know what any of the said Letters did concern. And truly if the party who pretends to be privie thereunto had acquainted him this Defendant therewith, hee this defendant would have examined the same, and punished the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and therefore conceives the said party was much to blame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the same all this while, being three years, if he knew the State was concerned therein. And also hopeth, that he shall not suffer for any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage therein, it being in his absence during his employment in the Publick businesse, he having done his uttermost endeavour for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance thereof:</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in <hi>August</hi> 1647. Captaine <hi>Rich</hi> came to <hi>Holy-head</hi> with the Post-Barque where a Packet from the Parliament stayed for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation but he left the Packet there, and went with the Barque to <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> water upon his own occasions, by which meanes the States service was neglected, and the Barque like to be lost.</p>
            <p>To the second Charge, this defendant saith, that about the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned, he this Defendant was at <hi>Holy-head,</hi> to see if there were any Packet there from the State, and finding none, hut only the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter Packet in a leather bagge, This Defendant conceived it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rather to goe to <hi>Chester</hi> to see if Master <hi>Walley,</hi> the States Agent had any service to command him for the Publick, then to returne only with the Merchants Letters, which this Defendant then left to be carryed by another Barque, then bound for <hi>Dublin</hi> from <hi>Holy-head.</hi> But this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:211673:3"/>Defendant denieth that he went to <hi>Chester</hi>-water upon his own occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or otherwise then upon the discharge of the duty of his place for the publike service, wherein if his Barque had miscarryed, this Defendant must have borne the losse of it himself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That in <hi>October</hi> 1648. The Barques was Commanded by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Jones</hi> for <hi>Chester</hi>-water to bring over the Packets, but contrarily went to <hi>Holy-head,</hi> where the Master took a fraight, and returned to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi> without a Packet, by which means the Packet were left at <hi>Chester,</hi> The Governour wanting his Intelligence to the great prejudice of the State.</p>
            <p>To the third Charge this Defendent saith that at the time therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Stage was setled at <hi>Holyhead,</hi> and the Packets there constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received. So as their is no probability, that the States Letters should be stayed at <hi>Chester</hi> for the Post Barques to carry them, when of course they were to be sent by Land to <hi>Holyhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That in <hi>December</hi> 1648. The Informat delivered a Packet to <hi>Daniell Nixon</hi> the Master of the Post Barque, with Command from the Governour to goe for <hi>Chester</hi>-water withall possible expedition, but <hi>Nixon</hi> contrary to Order lost that Night Tyde, being then busie about affaires for Captain <hi>Rich</hi> or his own advantage, the Barque being laden with heavy goods could not get off till full Sea, whereof the Informat getting knowledge in the next Morning, and perceiving the Barque was bound for <hi>Holy-head,</hi> was compelled to send the Packet aboard, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Clarke</hi> then riding in the Bay of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to the hazard of loosing both Packet and Boatemen by stormy weather, which if the Informat had not done the State might have lost that Intelligence, the Pyrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then busie at Sea.</p>
            <p>To the Fourth he this Defendent saith, That he doth not know of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny losse of a Tyde as thereby is pretended, nor that his Master the said <hi>Nixon</hi> lost his Tyde or neglected any Commands from Collonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and faith he was not Ingaged to receive Commands from the Informer, nor did his Instructions require him to attend the private but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Packet, yet in case that part of the Information had been true, the Informer confesseth the weather grew foule, and the Pyrates did infest the passage, which might be good Inducements to the Master at that time, not to run head long into danger, and this Defendent saith he doth not know that <hi>Nixon</hi> was then busied about any of the affairs of this Defendant.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:211673:4"/> 5. That not long after Captain <hi>Rich</hi> should have sent the Post Barque to <hi>Chester;</hi> but for his own advantage without this Informates knowledge sent her to <hi>Holy-head</hi> to unlade goods kept aboard her two months, and left the Packet behind, and stayed at <hi>Holy-head</hi> three weeks and went thence to <hi>Chester,</hi> and loaded with Coales, and thence retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Packet of the 16 of <hi>January,</hi> and put in againe to <hi>Holy-head</hi> the Wind being faire and tooke in more goods, by which means the Barque was taken, the Packet lost and those aboard undone.</p>
            <p>To the Fifth charge this Defendant saith, He knoweth nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he being then here attending the State, neither did he ever heare that Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> did Command the Barques for <hi>Chester</hi>-water, and saith he conceiveth it was his duty to deliver the Packets at <hi>Holy-head,</hi> only since the Stage was there setled, and saith if the then Master of the said Barque did in his this Defendants absence any of the matters herein charged as against this Defendent, the same was without his this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants knowledge or privity, and this Defendant is thereby become a great sufferer in the losse of his Barque, which cost him asmuch as a whole years wages amount unto, and as to the Prejudice pretended to be done to the Publicks service in any of the particulars here complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, this Defendant hopeth it shall be taken as in truth it is a meere surmise of his adversaries to supplant him in his employment. Since nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lieutenant Generall <hi>Jones</hi> nor Master <hi>Walley</hi> did ever question the same to this Defendants knowledge, nor acquainted this Defendant therewith, or complained to the State therein, but on the contrary have given Testimony of this Defendants readinesse and dilligence at all times to observe their Commands. <hi>Vide</hi> their Certificates.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the severall Packets of the 6.13 20. and 27. of <hi>Feburary</hi> 1648. Did not arrive at <hi>Dublin</hi> till the 23 of <hi>April</hi> 1649. For want of a Post Barque to transport them, notwithstanding the said <hi>Rich</hi> being bound at all times to have a Barque in reachnesse for the service.</p>
            <p>As to the Sixth, charge as to the long stay of the severall Packets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned this Defendant saith they were only the Merchants Packets, and howsoever could not receive a quicker conveyance from this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, if he would have taken upon him the carriage thereof out of curtesie as formerly, for that both the Defendant Barques, aswell, as that which the Informers have newly hired for his own use, were all three taken, One of this Defendants Barques called the <hi>Hare</hi> being carried to <hi>Wexford,</hi> and the other a Catch called the <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> being carried to the Isle of <hi>Man.</hi> Whereupon this Defendant bought the Catch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:211673:4"/>and provided the Speedwell into the Hares place, both which doe constantly attend the States service, as appeareth by both the Masters Oaths herewith presented. <hi>Vide</hi> the Affidavits.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That Captain <hi>Rich,</hi> did contract with the State to keep two able Barques for their service only, but did keep but one for fourteen months together, yet hath received his whole stipend for two, and that one Barque did make but one Voyage in the States service from the 30. of <hi>September</hi> 1648. to the eight of <hi>April</hi> 1649. And whereas the said Barques should at all times be in readinesse for the States service, and at no time unballanced, or laden and cumbred with Merchants goods, and yet whither he had one or two, they were alwayes unballasted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to take in Merchants goods or Coales for his own best advantage.</p>
            <p>To the seventh charge this Defendant saith, That he ever kept two sufficient Barques for the use of the State, save only in that time that both his said Barques were carryed away as aforesaid and then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided two Barques for the said Service withall the expedition he could, but denyeth that the same were unballanced at any time when there was occasion to use them for the States service, and as to that part of the charge concerning taking in of Goods aboard, this Defendant humbly offereth and saith, that although it bring in no profit to the Owner, yet it was never denyed the Servant, that whilst the Barques did attend, and before the Packet came to hand the men might take in some Truncks or Goods, which perhaps might produce for their advantage, and incouragement, sometimes ten shillings, or more or lesser as occasion offered; And the same was the Informers own practise in Master <hi>Withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> time, when he hired Barques for the Merchants Letters as by the Contracts may appeare, and thought sometimes, when the Barques goe for <hi>Chester</hi>-water, and the Packets were not ready, the Barques-night take in some Coales to pleasure this Defendant, or some Friends, yet was no prejudice done thereby to the States Service, as by Master <hi>Wallyes</hi> Letter to Master <hi>Frost,</hi> ready to be produced may appeare.</p>
            <p>All which this Defendant by way of answer to the said Information humbly offereth to the Grave Conside<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation of this Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and humbly craveth the Judgement thereof, he having always upon all occasions used his utmost diligence to performe the duty of his place, and you having received frequent testimonies of his care and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnensse therein, from Lieutenant Generall <hi>Iones,</hi> and also from <hi>Charls Walley</hi> the States on this side, and therefore hopeth, that this Accusation, contrived meerly by the Informer to supplant this Defendent in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment shall receive no favourable Construction.</p>

As also at all other times when he was required did much good service, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and maintaining the Bridge of Boats over the River, which was very advantageous to the present Service; For all which, as he affirmeth to us, and wee verily believe hath not received any satisfaction. And we make bold further to certifie, that in all the time of his very neere three years service, we never had any complaint of the Countrey of any injury done by him or his men, So that we can do no lesse, his service being such, and charge so great but represent it to your Honours, Humbly leaving his merits and rewards unto your more mature consideration.</p>
